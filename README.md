- 🛡️ Enterprise-Grade Security

## Features

### Core Providers
- **Agent Provider**: Intelligent agent lifecycle management
- **Communication Provider**: Advanced message handling
- **Learning Provider**: Adaptive skill acquisition
- **Memory Provider**: Semantic memory management
- **Persona Provider**: Contextual personality modeling
- **Reasoning Provider**: Cognitive processing
- **Security Provider**: Enterprise security management
- **Services Provider**: Service orchestration
- **Storage Provider**: Data management
- **Tools Provider**: Dynamic tool integration
- **Workflow Provider**: Process automation

## Licensing

### Key Licensing Tiers
- **Tier 0: Personal and Research Use (Free)**
  * Individual personal projects
  * Academic and non-commercial research
  * Experimental learning

- **Tier 1: Creator's License**
  * Small-scale commercial exploration
  * Startup and early-stage product development

### Commercial Use Thresholds
Mandatory commercial licensing is required if ALL of these are met:
- Annual revenue exceeds $50,000
- Concurrent users surpass 50
- Total user base exceeds 1,000
- Significant computational resource usage

**Important Note:** The following are NOT considered commercial use:
- Demonstrating project capabilities
- Streaming project demonstrations
- YouTube tutorials or showcases
- Discord/community event presentations
- Conference or academic presentations

Commercial use is strictly defined as direct deployment or selling of products/services using the framework.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- pip

### Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/SentientOne.git
cd SentientOne
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage Example
```python
from sentientone.providers import AgentProvider, PersonaProvider

# Create an intelligent agent
agent = AgentProvider.create_agent()
persona = PersonaProvider.create_persona()

# Interact with the agent
result = agent.process(persona)
```
