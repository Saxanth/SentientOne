# BaseReasoningProvider Development Roadmap

## Current Implementation Overview
- Developed initial framework for multi-paradigm reasoning
- Supports various reasoning approaches
- Provides comprehensive reasoning context tracking
- Enables flexible reasoning step management

## Key Insights
1. Reasoning Complexity
   - Reasoning is a multi-dimensional cognitive process
   - Requires adaptive and context-aware mechanisms
   - Needs sophisticated confidence estimation

2. Reasoning Representation Challenges
   - Current model is foundational
   - Needs more nuanced confidence and conclusion generation
   - Should incorporate multiple reasoning strategies

3. Reasoning Paradigm Limitations
   - Current enum-based approach provides initial structure
   - Requires more dynamic reasoning strategy implementation
   - Need to support emergent and hybrid reasoning approaches

## Research Directions
- Advanced cognitive processing models
- Multi-paradigm reasoning techniques
- Probabilistic and neural-symbolic reasoning
