# SentientOne Architecture

## Overview

SentientOne provides templates for building agent-based systems with different levels of complexity:

### Basic Agency Template
- Core structure for simple agent systems
- Essential task management
- Basic configuration
- Minimal dependencies

### Advanced Agency Template
- Full organizational structure
- Executive management layer
- Specialized agent roles
- Advanced task orchestration

## Template Components

### Core Components (Both Templates)
- Base agent implementation
- Task management system
- Configuration validation
- Simple messaging

### Advanced Components (Advanced Template)
- Executive team management
- Sentient Resources (SR)
- Department organization
- Performance monitoring
- Resource allocation

## Task Management

Tasks follow a simple lifecycle:
- PENDING: Task created
- ACTIVE: Under processing
- COMPLETED: Successfully finished
- FAILED: Error occurred

Priority levels:
- LOW: Background tasks
- MEDIUM: Standard operations
- HIGH: Important tasks
- CRITICAL: Urgent requirements

## Configuration Management

Each template provides:
- Default configuration
- Validation rules
- Extension points
- Documentation

## Best Practices

1. Keep tasks focused and atomic
2. Use appropriate template for your needs
3. Follow configuration guidelines
4. Implement proper error handling
5. Monitor agent performance

## Extension Points

Templates can be extended through:
1. New specialized agents
2. Custom departments
3. Additional task types
4. Enhanced monitoring

## Security Considerations

1. Task isolation
2. Agent permissions
3. Resource limits
4. Input validation

## Performance

Optimization areas:
1. Task scheduling
2. Resource allocation
3. Memory management
4. Communication patterns

## Future Directions

1. Additional templates
2. Enhanced monitoring
3. Advanced orchestration
4. Improved scalability
